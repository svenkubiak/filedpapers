Filed Papers
================

Filed Papers is built for those who value privacy and control. Unlike traditional bookmark managers, it requires a self-hosted backend, ensuring your data remains exclusively in your handsâ€”secure, private, and free from third-party access.

- Use the Web-Interface along with the additional iOS App and Google Chrome extension

Why Choose Filed Papers?
