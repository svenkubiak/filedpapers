# Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before starting the installation process, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system
- **Docker Compose**: Make sure Docker Compose is installed to manage multi-container applications
- **Web Frontend Server**: A frontend HTTP server (e.g., Nginx) to handle SSL termination and proxy requests to the backend.

## Installation

1. **Create the directory for your server installation:**

   First, create a folder where you want to install your server. For this example, we will use the folder name `filedpapers`.

   ```shell
   mkdir filedpapers
   cd filedpapers
   ```
2. **Download and execute the installation script:**

   ```shell
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenkubiak/filedpapers/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

Once the installation is complete, you can configure your environment in the compose.yml and .env files as required.
